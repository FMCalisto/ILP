# Introduction

## Objectives
The main purpose of this assignment is to provide the students with a straight and close contact to the
operation of a pipelined computer architecture, as well as to the techniques that are commonly applied
in order to maximize the efficiency of the developed computer programs. For that purpose, a dedicated
simulation environment will be adopted: the WinMIPS64, version 1.57.

# Environment

WinMIPS64 is a simulator and a visual debugger of a subset of the MIPS64 Instruction Set Architecture
(ISA). It was developed at Dublin City University School of Computing (Ireland) for educational purposes
and it is capable of executing small programs that comply with the supported subset of theMIPS64
ISA.

The main reason for adopting WinMIPS64 is its educational value in helping to understand the inner
workings of pipelines. It provides a graphical interface that allows users to observe the execution of
instructions through the multiple stages of the pipeline. Furthermore, the user has the capability of
seeing how stalls are introduced and handled by the CPU, inspecting the status of registers and memory,
and controlling step by step the execution of instructions.
